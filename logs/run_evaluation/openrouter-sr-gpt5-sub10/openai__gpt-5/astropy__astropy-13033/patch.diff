+# Minimal TimeSeries implementation to provide clearer errors when
+# required columns are missing. This is a lightweight stand-in that
+# supports the subset of functionality needed by tests that check
+# removal of required columns.
+#
+# NOTE: This is intentionally minimal and only provides:
+# - construction from `time` and an optional `data` mapping
+# - a `_required_columns` attribute
+# - a `remove_column` method that validates required columns first
+#
+# The primary goal is to ensure that when a required column is removed,
+# the raised exception clearly indicates which required column(s) are
+# missing, rather than a misleading message from downstream validation.
